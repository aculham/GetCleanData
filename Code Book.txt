The data used in this work was originally obtained from the location here:
	https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip



The original data was split into two groups, train and test.  The files contained data in the following way:
	x 		- 	the actual raw data
	y 		- 	the activity being performed (ID only)
	features 	- 	the metric being recorded 
	activities	-	map of activity ID to description



The following steps were taken with the data:
	1. Combine x_train, y_train, subject_train with x_test, y_test, subject_test, respectively
	2. Add some meaningful column names: activityID to y, subjectID to subjects, features to x.  Features can be found in its own txt file called features.txt.
	3. Combine the above three sets into one
	4. Determine which features contain information about mean and std.  This was open to some interpretation.  However, after examining the feature names I felt that those features which contained mean() and std() were the ones we were interested in.
	5. Remove all columns without mean() or std() in their feature name
	6. Replace the activityID with a descriptive activity name, as found in activity_labels.txt
	7. Melt the data to transform it to a long dataset instead of wide
	8. Use SQL to compute the mean of each feature, for each subject and each activity
	9. Store the resulting dataset in a variable called final_data
